what .js-language can do with HTML-page in browser-envi?


using browser provided web-APIs,
JavaScript-lang can bring any dynamic activity/data to web-page

browser-APIs :  ==> are based on 'w3c' recommendations
they are implemented & abstracted as JavaScript objects & functions


browser-APIs  :
    ==> DOM, XHR/fetch,Timer,..

using DOM API
--------------
 -> can create,retreive,update,delete HTML elements
 -> can change element's inner text/html content 
 -> can change element's attributes/properties
 -> can change element's styles ( css )
 -> can validate form-fields 
 -> can create rich UI-components
 .........

using XHR/fetch api
---------------------
-> can communicate with server-side programs async ( AJAX )

using Timer API
-----------------
-> can execute any action on timeout/time-interval

HTML-5 : APIs

server-side page techonologies

    -> .jsp + JSF , PHP , ASP , etc....

    limitations with server-side page techonologies

        => on every req, server need to re-construct same UI-layout with new content, keeping client state
        => on every req, need to tranfer heavy content from server, leads increasing n/w bandwidth
        => on every resp, broswer need to re-load current page



problems with plain-js ( your-code ) with browser apis
------------------------------------------------------

-> browser compatability issues
-> memory issues ( i.e cleaning un-used DOM elements)
-> performance issues ( i.e DOM changes should be minimal)
-> data-binding is manual
-> too much code for simple operations
-> code organization is too difficult


 soln : using third-party's JavaScript lib & F.Ws


 1. jQuery ( DOM utility lib )

 MVC & MVVM based js lib & F.Ws

 2. Knockout
 3. Backbone
 4. Emberjs
 5. AngularJS from google-team
 6. DOJO
 7. EXTJS
 8. YUI
 .............

 w3c => web-component / custom html-element spec

component-based arch

 1. React  from facebook ( our focus )
 2. Angular from google-team
